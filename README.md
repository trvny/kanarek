Kanarek combines two tools in one native application:

- an RSS/Atom reader with an auto-rotating home-screen news widget,
- a background internet radio and IPTV player with its own transport-control widget.

An optional Cloudflare Worker accelerates fetching and provides additional network features. It is not required: ordinary RSS/Atom feeds can be parsed directly on the device.

## Highlights

### News

- resizable slideshow widget with manual navigation and per-widget settings,
- custom RSS 2.0 and Atom sources with OPML import and export,
- local search, source filters, and an optional headline-ranking mode,
- read state, saved articles, and optional offline clean text,
- clean article preview when a trusted Worker backend is configured,
- optional new-story notifications with quiet hours,
- last-known-good stories stay visible when an individual source temporarily fails.

### Radio and IPTV

- background Media3/ExoPlayer playback with system media controls,
- M3U/M3U8 import, export, and editing,
- radio, television, channel groups, favorites, and now-playing metadata,
- station discovery through the Radio Browser directory,
- missing channel logos filled through iptv-org and favicon fallbacks,
- playlist-provided `User-Agent` and `Referer` support,
- Google Cast in the `play` flavor; the `foss` flavor is Google-services-free.

## Install

Ready-made APKs are published under [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/trvny/feeds/releases).

- `play`: includes Google Cast support,
- `foss`: GMS-free build intended for FOSS and F-Droid environments.

The minimum supported system is Android 8.0 (API 26).

## Quick start

1. Install the preferred APK flavor.
2. Open Kanarek and choose **News** or **Radio & TV**.
3. Add RSS/Atom sources or import an OPML file.
4. Add stations manually, search the radio directory, or import an M3U/M3U8 playlist.
5. Long-press the Android home screen, open **Widgets**, and add either Kanarek widget.

The Backend URL may remain blank: regular feed refreshes stay on-device, while feed discovery, station search, and logo lookup can use Kanarek's built-in default service. Set your own Worker URL only when you want normal feed refreshes routed through that Worker or operator-controlled features such as clean-reader extraction and synchronized state.
